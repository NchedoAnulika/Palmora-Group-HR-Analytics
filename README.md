# Palmora Group HR Analysis â€“ Power BI Case Study
A Power BI HR analytics case study for Palmora Group, focused on analyzing gender distribution, pay equity, performance ratings, and bonus allocation across departments and regions.

## Project Summary

This HR analytics case study investigates organizational inequality at **Palmora Group**, a manufacturing company in Nigeria facing negative press regarding **gender imbalance** and potential **pay inequities**. The company's leadership commissioned this analysis to uncover the root causes and guide data-driven decision-making.

As the HR Analytics expert, I analyzed employee data across departments and regions to identify disparities in gender representation, salary structures, and bonus distributions tied to performance ratings.
